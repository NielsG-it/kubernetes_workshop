# Kubernetes workloads

# Deployments

Deployments represent a set of multiple, identical Pods with no unique identities. A Deployment runs multiple replicas of your application and automatically replaces any instances that fail or become unresponsive. In this way, Deployments help ensure that one or more instances of your application are available to serve user requests. Deployments are managed by the Kubernetes Deployment controller.
Deployments use a Pod template, which contains a specification for its Pods. The Pod specification determines how each Pod should look like: what applications should run inside its containers, which volumes the Pods should mount, its labels, and more.
When a Deployment's Pod template is changed, new Pods are automatically created one at a time.
You can create your own deployment using using the kubectl CLI tool:
```
kubectl create deployment example --image=nginx:1.16.1
```
deployment "example" created
You can see the deployment you just created with:
```
kubectl get deployments
```
NAME                           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
example                        1         1         1            1           1m
And you can see the replicasets created by the deployments using:
```
kubectl get replicasets
```
NAME                                     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE

To see the details of the deployment use:
```
kubectl describe deployment example
```
Name:           example
Namespace:      platform

We can scale the deployment to a larger number of pods using:
```
kubectl scale deployment example --replicas=2
```
deployment "example" scaled
As you can see by viewing the pods deployed:
```
kubectl get pods
```
NAME                                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
example-1745274054-5d8r7                       1/1       Running   0          51s
example-1745274054-qm9h0                       1/1       Running   0          7m
Delete a pod and see that it will be recreated by kubernetes:
```
kubectl delete pod example-1745274054-qm9h0
```
pod "example-1745274054-qm9h0" deleted

```
kubectl get pods
```
NAME                       READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
example-1745274054-5d8r7   1/1       Running       0          1m
example-1745274054-qm9h0   1/1       Terminating   0          43s
example-4113047535-wr6sw   1/1       Running       0          4s
Now we want to upgrade our deployment to a new version. First we check the strategy for this deployment. This can be either: RollingUpdate or Recreate. Default this is set to RollingUpdate. The controller will than always keep a minimum amount of pods available. With Recreate all pods are first destroyed before new ones are created.
```
kubectl get deployment example -o yaml
```
...
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
    type: RollingUpdate
...
We want to update our webserver container to the new Nginx version 1.17.8. To upgrade our example deployment we can either edit our deployment using:
method 1: edit the deployment and change the version, this will open the running Yaml in a VI editor.
```
kubectl edit deployment example
```
method 2: specify the new image using the command line
```
kubectl set image deployment example nginx=nginx:1.17.8
```
deployment "example" image updated
After this you can view the status of the rollout using:
```
kubectl rollout status deployment example
```
deployment "example" successfully rolled out
You can now also see two replicasets (old and new) using:
```
kubectl get replicasets
```
NAME                                     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
example-1745274054                       0         0         0         35m
example-824231406                        2         2         2         2m
You can undo a deployment using:
```
kubectl rollout undo deployment example
```
deployment "example" rolled back

8 persistent storage
Not all your applicaties will probably be stateless. To enable applications which need a form of state stored on disk you can use persistent volume claims. Kubernetes doen't come out of the box with a storage solution. There are several ways to enalbe the persistent storage and hand out persistent volumes to the applications.
We will create our own persistant volume and persistent volume claim and link a deployment to it. First make a directory on the host:
```
mkdir /workshop-volume
```
Create a file called: pv.yml with the following content:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: task-pv-volume
  labels:
    type: local
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/workshop-volume"
```
Now create the pv using:
```
kubectl apply -f pv.yml
```
persistentvolume "task-pv-volume" created
On this PV we will create the PersistentVolumeClaim, this is also done with a yaml file. Create a file called: pvc.yml with the following content:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 4Gi
```
Now create the pvc using:
```
kubectl apply -f pvc.yml
```
persistentvolumeclaim "my-pvc" created
You can get the status and see if the persistent volume has been bound to a persistent volume.
```
kubectl get pvc my-pvc
```
NAME      STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   STORAGECLASS        AGE

```
kubectl describe pvc my-pvc
```
Name:           my-pvc
Namespace:      namespace11
StorageClass:   glusterfs-storage
Status:         Bound
Volume:         pvc-c1acaf5c-93ce-11e7-a20d-000d3a2a7d16
Labels:         <none>
Annotations:    pv.kubernetes.io/bind-completed=yes
                pv.kubernetes.io/bound-by-controller=yes
                volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class=glusterfs-storage
                volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-provisioner=kubernetes.io/glusterfs
Capacity:       1Gi
Access Modes:   RWO
Events:         <none>
We can bound this volume to a set of containers, e.g. to a deployment:
Create a file called deployment-with-pvc.yml This is a deployment for a MySQL database with persistant storage
```
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql
  labels:
    app: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
      tier: mysql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
        tier: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: mysql:5.6
        name: mysql
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: "password"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
          name: mysql
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: my-pvc
```
and create the deployment with:
```
kubectl apply -f deployment-with-pvc.yml
```
When you go into one of the pods you should be able to see the attached volume. Find the pod id with kubectl get pods and go into the pod with kubectl exec:
```
kubectl get pods
```

```
kubectl exec -it [pod-name] bash
```
