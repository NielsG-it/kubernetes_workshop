# Exposing Kubernetes workloads

## Service & Labels

To expose a pod you should create a service. We will use the earlier created pods. With the service, you will create a ClusterIP to forward traffic to the different pods. To create a service use:

```bash
kubectl create service clusterip example --tcp=80:80
```

```
service "example" created
```

Now you have a service with a ClusterIP created. The service will direct all traffic sent to its ClusterIP to the pod with a label `app=example`.

To view the details of this service use:

```bash
kubectl describe service example
```

```
Name:           example
Namespace:      platform
Labels:         app=example
Selector:       app=example
Type:           ClusterIP
IP:             10.0.19.127
Port:           80-80   80/TCP
Endpoints:      <none>
Session Affinity:   None
No events.
```

As you can see, no Endpoints are present yet. This is because no pods exist with the label `app=example`. To direct traffic from this service to the correct pod, you should add this label to the pod example. Do this with the following command:

```bash
kubectl label pod example app=example
```

```
pod "example" labeled
```

Now when you describe the service example, you should see an endpoint belonging to this service:

```bash
kubectl describe service example
```

```
Name:           example
Namespace:      platform
Labels:         app=example
Selector:       app=example
Type:           ClusterIP
IP:             10.0.19.127
Port:           80-80   80/TCP
Endpoints:      10.47.0.14:80
Session Affinity:   None
No events.
```

For other pods within this namespace, the example pod can be reached by the name `example`.

A service can front more than one pod. It actually fronts every pod with matching labels. We can, for example, create a second pod and add the same labels to it:

```bash
kubectl run second-example-pod --image=nginx --port 80 --restart=Never
```

```
pod "second-example-pod" created
```

When we also add the same label to this pod, our service will also note this pod as an endpoint:

```bash
kubectl label pod second-example-pod app=example
```

```
pod "second-example-pod" labeled
```

```bash
kubectl describe service example
```

```
Name:           example
Namespace:      platform
Labels:         app=example
Selector:       app=example
Type:           ClusterIP
IP:             10.0.19.127
Port:           80-80   80/TCP
Endpoints:      10.35.0.2:80,10.47.0.14:80
Session Affinity:   None
No events.
```

You can see that there are now 2 endpoints behind this service. The service will load balance between those endpoints.

## Ingresses

To make a service available outside the cluster, we can either use a NodePort or an Ingress. NodePorts have the disadvantage that you need to keep record of the ports you use to expose a service. Each NodePort is exposed on every node in the cluster. A better way is using Ingresses. An Ingress uses name-based or path-based HTTP routing to send the traffic to the correct service within the cluster.

First, we create a file named `example-ingress.yml` containing:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: example
          servicePort: 80
```

Take a good look at this configuration and create this ingress using:

```bash
kubectl apply -f example-ingress.yml
```

```
ingress "example" created
```

To see the detailed information about the ingress you created, you can use the `kubectl describe` command:

```bash
kubectl describe ingress example
```

```
Name:             example
Namespace:        default
Address:          192.168.1.101
Default backend:  default-http-backend:80 (<none>)
Rules:
  Host  Path  Backends
  ----  ----  --------
  *
        /   example:80 (10.42.0.23:80,10.42.0.29:80,10.42.0.30:80 + 1 more...)
Annotations:
  kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration:  {"apiVersion":"networking.k8s.io/v1beta1","kind":"Ingress","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"example","namespace":"default"},"spec":{"rules":[{"http":{"paths":[{"backend":{"serviceName":"example","servicePort":80},"path":"/"}]}}]}}

Events:  <none>
```

You can see the address where the ingress is exposed. This is the IP address of the server. So now you can reach the website with `curl [IP address]` or with the browser pointing towards the public IP of the server. Note! It's required that there is an open firewall port between your browser and the server.

We can clean up the pods and services by deleting them:

```bash
kubectl delete pod example
```

```
pod "example" deleted
```

```bash
kubectl delete pod second-example-pod
```

```
pod "second-example-pod" deleted
```

```bash
kubectl delete service example
```

```
service "example" deleted
```
